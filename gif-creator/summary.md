# MoviePy Import Fix

## Problem
The `uv run python3 gif_web.py` command was failing with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'moviepy.editor'` error.

## Root Cause
The code was using the old MoviePy import syntax (`import moviepy.editor as mpy`) which is not available in MoviePy version 2.x. The newer version has a different module structure.

## Changes Made
In `image_to_gif_creator.py`:
- Removed: `import moviepy.editor as mpy`
- Removed: `from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip` 
- Added: `from moviepy import VideoFileClip`

## Why This Fixed It
MoviePy 2.x restructured its imports. Instead of having a separate `moviepy.editor` module, the classes like `VideoFileClip` are now directly available from the main `moviepy` package. The fix updates the import statements to use the correct syntax for the installed version (2.2.1).

# Network Access Configuration

## Problem
When running on a Digital Ocean VPS, accessing the web interface at `<DROPLET_PUBLIC_IP>:7860` resulted in "connection refused" errors.

## Root Cause
Gradio's `demo.launch()` defaults to `server_name="127.0.0.1"` which only binds to localhost, preventing external access to the web interface.

## Changes Made
In `gif_web.py`:
- Changed: `demo.launch()` 
- To: `demo.launch(server_name="0.0.0.0", server_port=7860)`

## Why This Fixed It
By setting `server_name="0.0.0.0"`, the application binds to all network interfaces, allowing external connections. This differs from the alternative `share=True` approach:

**Binding to all interfaces (`server_name="0.0.0.0"`):**
- Uses VPS's public IP directly
- Better for production/dedicated hosting
- Requires firewall configuration (`sudo ufw allow 7860`)
- Direct connection to your server

**Gradio share (`share=True`):**
- Creates temporary public tunnel via Gradio's servers
- No firewall config needed
- Gets random `*.gradio.live` URL that expires
- Good for demos/testing, not permanent hosting
